The teacher of today is the salt of the earth. He wants to create a man, not just make money. He is a knowledgeable gentleman. He is an expert in the particular subject he teaches. Though a scholar, he teaches the subject in such a way that all students, brilliant or ordinary, can fully understand him. He doesnâ€™t advertise his knowledge. He cares about his students and offers assistance to them both inside and outside of the classroom. He attends his work regularly.
